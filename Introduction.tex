\section{Introduction}
	\subsection{Problem Background}
	As an indespensable part of our terrestrial ecosystem, fungi free the carbon and other elements out from remains and debris and drive them into the ecosystem. Fungi tend to live in warm and humid environment,and are sensitive with the smallest changes.

	In this study, we focus on the interaction between different population of fungi and how they interact with microenvironment around them on woddy fibres. We use cmpetitive Lotka-Voterra model to demostrate the competition among different types of fungi.

	\subsection{Our Work}
	Our work mainly includes the following:
	\begin{enumerate}[\bfseries 1.]
		\item We use Lotka-Volterra Equations to build a model to demonstrate the competition among different types of fungi.
		\item We build a model to explain how the process of decomposition is affected by temperature, moisture, and distribution of different tuypes of fungi.
		\item We analyse the sensitivity and robustness of the models above.
	\end{enumerate}
