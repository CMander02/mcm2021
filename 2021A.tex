\title{Analysis and Prediction of Fungi Decomposition Process}

\begin{document}

	\begin{abstract}
		As an indespensable part of our terrestrial ecosystem, fungi free the carbon and other elements out from remains and debris and drive them into the cycle of ecosystem. Fungi tend to live in warm and humid environment,and are sensitive to the smallest changes.In this study, we focus on the interaction between different population of fungi and how they interact with microenvironment around them on woddy fibres. 

		In our first model, we use cmpetitive Lotka-Voterra model to demostrate the competition among different types of fungi. After the estimation of some important parameters, we simulate the gorwth of several population of  fungi  fed on infinite nutrition with no competition. The result shows that.
		
		In our second model, we mainly sudy the comprtition behavior of the fungi when woody fibres are not infinite. We add the influence of model to demonstrate the competition the competition among different types of fungi.addada. \\
