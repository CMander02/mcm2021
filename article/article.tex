Fungi play a crucial role in the balance of  our ecosystem. They scatter in most habitats on Earth, preferring moist and temperate conditions, and are very seneitive of that. Fungi are one of the major decomposers of nature, thanks to their versatile metabolism, fungi break down organic matter, which would not otherwise be recycled.

Fungi are important to our daily life. Fungi are important decomposers in most ecosystems. They free the carbon in the debris remains and waste of living creatures, and drive then back into the carbon cycle.
If fungi and bacteria did not return them to the environment via their metabolism, it would remain tied up in rotting organic matter.

Our recent study shows that fungi    decomposites 75\% of woody fibres they live on in just * days, and the process are extermely sensitive to the temperature, moisture and the pressure other fungi gives to them. 

According to the research, the change of climate will always lead to the change of fungi living there. if
